# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat help
yarn hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true yarn hardhat test
yarn hardhat node
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js

### to deploy smartcontract on specific network we use the following command:
yarn hardhat run deploy --network <network-name>
```

by default it uses harhdhat network

```

```

### to clean artifacts and cache

yarn hardhat clean

```

```
